#Pandas Grading SDK

### iOS Project Requirements

Deployment target: iOS 12
Swift version: 5.0

## Installing the library

### Swift Package Manager

In the project's Package Dependencies add a new dependency for url https://github.com/greenpandaio/grading-sdk-ios-spm and set the desired version.

After the PandasGradingSDK package is fetched, drag and drop the PandasGradingSDK.bundle from the package contents folder to the project root checking "Copy items if needed".
Then include it in the project's target(Project settings -> targets -> Frameworks, Libraries & Embedded Content -> Add PandasGradingSDK).

For the CocoaPods legacy installation refer to [the cocoa pod installation instructions](CocoaPodsInstall.md)

## Configuring the SDK

### Construct your basic configuration object:

```swift
        let gradingSDKConfig = GradingSDKConfig(
            environment: .staging,
            partner: Partner(
                id: "c9583b49-deb2-47a5-9653-f94328a6a9a8",
                name: "pandas",
                code: "pandas_sdk",
                token: "895cfd33feef1ac61997137b43ecbb155a8c465ed9aa67efa71463ec8d5e44d7"
            ),
            theme: Theme(
                colors: ThemeColors(
                    mainColor: "#222222"
                ),
                images: ThemeImages(
                    splashScreen: UIImage(named: "splash-screen1"),
                    digitizer: UIImage(named: "splash-screen1"),
                    qrLogo: nil
                ),
                fonts: ThemeFonts( // UIFont supported font family
                    primary: "Helvetica",
                    secondary: "Helvetica"
                                 ),
                customStrings: nil // Overide content with custom strings.xml url
            )

```

Before starting the SDK you need to call the `configure` public method of `PandasGrading` shared instance with the corresponding configuration object:

```swift
PandasGrading.shared.configure(sdkConfig: gradingSDKConfig)
```

### Environment configuration

The environment can be set with the `environment` parameter. `.staging`,`.uat` or `.production`.
Note: When `.staging` is set, all cosmetic evaluation tests will result in dummy successfull responses.

## Using the SDK

### Create a per flow configuration.

The SDK supports the following flows:

- `FlowConfigBase.TradeInConfig.TradeInConfigHome(params explained below)` - Evaluates the device for trade in from home

- `FlowConfigBase.TradeInConfig.TradeInConfigStore(params explained below)` - Evaluates the device for trade in at a store

- `FlowConfigBase.EligibilityConfig(params explained below)` - Evaluates the current device for warranty eligibility'

- `FlowConfigBase.EligibilityPeerConfig(params explained below)` - Evaluates another device for warranty eligibility

### Start a device assessment flow

The grading flow is started using the `startGrading` function of PandasGrading shared instance.

```swift
        PandasGrading.shared.startGrading(
            navigationController: yourUInavigationController //The instance of the calling UINavigationController,
            flowConfig: flowConfiguration //Your flow configuration(See below),
            sessionId: sessionId //Optional Session id to resume.,
            imei: imei //Optional the IMEI of the device for identification and analytics.
        )

```

### Available flow configurations

#### Eligibility

Evaluates the current device for warranty eligibility

##### Define an ordered list of assessments(tests) that need to be performed.

```swift
        let tradeInAssessments: [GradingTest] = [
            .cosmeticGrading,
            .digitizer,
            .soundPerformance,
        ]
            flowConfiguration =  EligibilityConfig(
                privacyPolicy: true, // Toggles privacy policy consent screen
                assessments: tradeInAssessments // Configures the tests that are going to be performed.
            )
```

#### EligibilityPeer

Evaluates another device for warranty eligibility

```swift
            flowConfiguration =  EligibilityPeerConfig(
                privacyPolicy: true // Toggles privacy policy consent screen
            )
```

#### Eligibility flows - Results output

The eligibility flow completion handling is done by implementing the PandasGradingDelegate protocol. The instance of the class implementing the protocol must be set on the PandasGrading shared instance delegate property. The protocol contains a method which provides an EligibilityFlowResult parameter, which can have the following values: success, failed or skipped as well as the session id.

`public protocol PandasGradingDelegate: AnyObject {
    func eligibilityFlowEnded(result: EligibilityFlowResult)
}`

for example

```swift
extension AppDelegate: PandasGradingDelegate {
    func eligibilityFlowEnded(sessionId: String,
                              result: PandasGradingSDK.EligibilityFlowResult,
                              assessmentResults: [String : String],
                              batteryStats: PandasGradingSDK.BatteryStats?,
                              exitScreen: ExitScreen?) {
        print("\n\neligibility flow for session: \(sessionId), ended with result: \(result), assessments: \(assessmentResults), battery stats: \(batteryStats), exit screen: \(exitScreen)\n\n")
    }
}
```

### TradeInAtHome - TradeInAtStore

##### Define an ordered list of assessments(tests) that need to be performed.

```swift
        let tradeInAssessments: [GradingTest] = [
            .cosmeticGrading,
            .digitizer,
            .soundPerformance,
            .multitouch,
            .deviceMotion,
            .biometrics,
            .frontCamera,
            .backCamera
        ]
```

##### (Home flow only) Define the available device drop off options

```swift
let tradeInDropOffOptions: [DropOffOption] = [.atStore, .courierAtStore]
```

##### Initialise a TradeInConfigHome or TradeInConfigStore object

```swift
            flowConfiguration = TradeInConfig(
                flowType: .home,
                privacyPolicy: false, // Toggles privacy policy consent screen
                assessments: tradeInAssessments,// Configures the tests that are going to be performed.
                emailSubmission: false, //Requires user email to display the offer
                dropOffOptions: tradeInDropOffOptions, // Configures which drop off options are available for trade in.
                storeLocationsUrl: tradeInLocationsUrl //Loads the store locations webpage url in a webview
            )
```

### Privacy usage descriptions

Depending on the assessments that are going to be configured, the SDK needs permission for certain device capabilities.
Therefore the app needs to include in the `Info.plist` file the following items:

- Privacy - Camera Usage Description (Camera tests)
- Privacy - Face ID Usage Description (Biometrics tests)
- Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description (TradeInFromHome flow)
- Privacy - Microphone Usage Description (Sound test)

In case any of theese tests are not configured, the corresponding permissions are not required.

## Extended configuration.

colorConfig , fontConfig , stringsURL are optional and should be provided if you want to override the default values.

### Color scheme

The color scheme is updated by providing a `ColorConfig` object, containing the color hex values. The colors which should not be updated can be omitted from the color config

**Sample**

```
let colorConfig = ColorConfig(shadow: UIColor(hex: "#F5F5F5"),
                              border: UIColor(hex: "#E0E0E0"),
                              white: UIColor(hex: "#FFFFFF"),
                              red: UIColor(hex: "#FF5151"),
                              light_red: UIColor(hex: "#FFDBDD"),
                              green: UIColor(hex: "#1FAD43"),
                              concrete: UIColor(hex: "#F2F2F2"),
                              light_green: UIColor(hex: "#BBFFCC80"),
                              aero_blue: UIColor(hex: "#BBFFCC"),
                              dark: UIColor(hex: "#1D1D1D"),
                              dark_2: UIColor(hex: "#1A1A1A"),
                              nobel: UIColor(hex: "#B3B3B3"),
                              grey: UIColor(hex: "#6C6C6C"),
                              grey_light: UIColor(hex: "#93989E"),
                              grey_lighter: UIColor(hex: "#cccccc"),
                              gray_4: UIColor(hex: "#808080"),
                              gray_5: UIColor(hex: "#666666"),
                              gray_6: UIColor(hex: "#717171"),
                              background_grey: UIColor(hex: "#F7F7F7"),
                              brand_new: UIColor(hex: "#CE90FF"),
                              brand_new_light UIColor(hex: "#E1C8FB"),
                              good: UIColor(hex: "#79E795"),
                              good_light: UIColor(hex: "#DAFAE5"),
                              poor: UIColor(hex: "#FFBF00"),
                              poor_light: UIColor(hex: "#FDEDA6"),
                              fail: UIColor(hex: "#FF4B55"))

The file format should be mp4 for videos and gif for the logo.

The animation names are described in the enum below:

```
enum AnimationItem: String {
    case evaluateDigitizer = "evaluate-digitizer.mp4"
    case likeHeart = "like-heart.mp4"
    case logo = "white-logo.gif"
    case tutorial1 = "carousel-trade-in.mp4"
    case tutorial2 = "carousel-evaluation.mp4"
    case tutorial3 = "carousel-dropoff.mp4"
}
```
